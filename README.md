# Sound Of Rain WordPress Plugin
Ok, I needed to give instructions for setting it up - locally though. 

#### Step 1. 
Create a new folder (name of your choice) in this location: <i> project-name\wp-content\plugins </i>

#### Step 2.
Clone this file into that folder or ctrl-c + ctrl-v; Hey, it's your device, you do you!

#### Step 3.
Save changes - of course. And now, it should be available on your project dashboard. <strong> Activate it! </strong>

And boom, we're done! If you've never heard the song, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tky406Tczwk">you're welcome</a>.

<sub><sup>I really hope I don't get copyright strikes, I was just passing time at work.</sup></sub>

#### Feel free to send any queries and contributions. Cheers!
